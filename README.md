# FriendlyChat
An app that sends messages to and gets messages from Google Firebase

## Overview

This is a test program to explore some of Google Firebase's API

## Technologies and Concepts Used
   
   Firebase, UIKit, Cocoapods
   
## Example usage

   Download and run in the simulator.  
   Create a sign in or login with facebook.  
   Send a message you should receive it back.  
   Ideally you would have another client open on another computer or a device and see the message sent to the other device in realtime. 

## How to set up the dev environment
  
   Download the app.  
   On the command line open the FriendlyChat folder.  
   If you don't have cocoapods installed, install it now `gem install cocoapods`.  
   Then run the command `pod install`.  
   Open the file called: FriendlyChatSwift.xcworkspace.  
   Now you can run the app in Xcode's simulator.
